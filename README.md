## urlShortener

- Url Shortener project involves the development of a user-friendly and responsive React application that enables users to create and manage shortened URLs. The frontend of the application has been built using React, ensuring an intuitive and seamless user experience. Users can easily generate short URLs for long links and organize them efficiently.

- On the backend, the project utilizes the Java Spring Boot framework to handle the business logic and data management. The Spring Boot framework provides a robust and efficient foundation for building RESTful APIs. This allows the application to handle requests from the frontend, process the data, and interact with the database.

- To ensure the security of the REST API endpoints, various measures have been implemented. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are utilized for authentication and authorization, providing secure access to the application's resources. OAuth2 authentication is also implemented, enhancing the security of user data and preventing unauthorized access. The Spring Security framework is employed to enforce these security measures effectively.

- The application has been deployed on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform, utilizing Docker images for containerization. This deployment approach ensures scalability, flexibility, and easy management of the application. By leveraging AWS services, the application benefits from high availability, reliability, and performance.
